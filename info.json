"description":"We’re a company founded by bioethicist/attorney David Koepsell and pharmacogenomic scientist Vanessa Gonzalez to solve two problems at once: a) scientists need lots of genomic data, and b) people who are buying genetic testing from consumer testing companies don’t share their profits from selling data. Founded in 2017, the company first demonstrated its prototype in May 2017 at the Bio-IT World conference in Boston. With angel investment and a limited token sale of its $DNA utility coin in June 2017, the product was finalized and launched, as announced in The Scientist magazine, November 6, 2018, as the world’s first blockchain-mediated free market for genetic data. Since then, its community of supporters and users has grown virally, and various partnerships and platform developments have poised the company for consumer growth. It remains the only free market for genomic data powered by blockchain, and is committed to democratizing and decentralizing science (De-Sci), allowing individuals to make choices and benefit monetarily through their contributions to research.",
